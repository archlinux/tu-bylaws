Summary

This document describes the bylaws of the Trusted User group, its mission, and
duties.

Mission
-------

The Trusted Users (TUs) serve the following purposes:

1. Maintain +[community]+ as an intermediary between Archlinux's official
repositories and the +unsupported+ package collection in the AUR.

2. Maintain, manage, and watch over the operation of the AUR.

Bylaws
------

The bylaws are written to be consistent with the mission of the TUs,
and to ensure that TUs continue to be *Trusted* in the future. They
are also written with the intent to keep the TU organization a
thriving one, fulfilling its purpose.

Standard Voting Procedure
-------------------------

Standard Voting Procedure (SVP) describes the formal procedure used by TUs to
accept or reject proposals regarding TU affairs.

SVP begins with a proposal, for example the addition of a TU or an amendment to
the bylaws. The proposal should be clear and concise and it must be posted on
the https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general
mailing list] (aur-general). The proposal must also be worded unambiguously,
such that a YES or NO answer may be given.

The discussion period begins when the proposal is posted on
https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general]. The
duration of the discussion period shall be 5 full days UNLESS otherwise stated
in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal. Official discussion shall
take place on
https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general]. During
the discussion period, votes shall not be cast.

The voting period begins when the discussion period ends. The duration of the
voting period shall be 7 full days UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of the
bylaws pertaining to the proposal. During the voting period, TUs may vote YES,
NO or ABSTAIN. Votes shall be cast under the Trusted User section of the
https://aur.archlinux.org/[AUR website]. At the end of the voting period, all
votes shall be tallied.

The proposal is accepted if EITHER

1. the number of YES votes is greater than half the number of TUs OR

2. quorum has been established and the number of YES votes is greater than the
number of NO votes

UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal.

The proposal is rejected if EITHER

1. the number of NO votes is greater than or equal to half the number of TUs OR

2. quorum has been established and the number of NO votes is greater than or
equal to the number of YES votes

UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal.

A rejected proposal may not be presented again before a waiting period has
passed. The duration of the waiting period shall be 3 full months UNLESS
otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal. The
waiting period begins at the end of the voting period.

If quorum is not established by the end of the voting period then the proposal
is neither accepted nor rejected. A second SVP shall begin to establish the
status of the proposal. If the proposal is not accepted at the end of the
second SVP then it shall be rejected.

[[Q]]
Quorum
------

Quorums ensure that all matters decided by vote are representative of the TU
group. All TUs are expected to participate in all votes and the preceding
discussions whenever possible.

Quorum shall be 66% of all TUs and participation shall be measured by
the sum of YES, NO and ABSTAIN votes, UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of
the bylaws pertaining to the proposal. The total number of TUs is recorded at
the beginning of the voting period.

Addition of a TU
----------------

The addition of a TU may occur at any time.

In order to become a TU, one must first find a sponsoring TU,
and arrange privately with them to announce their candidacy on the
https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general] mailing
list.  Following the announcement, standard voting procedure commences with a
discussion period of 5 days, a quorum of 66%, and a voting period of 7 days.

If a candidate is rejected by SVP, they may not reapply to become a Trusted
User for a period of three months.

Removal of a TU
---------------

The removal of a TU may also occur at any time.

A motion for the removal of a TU must be made by at least 2 TUs. The motion must
be sent to
https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general], and
contain a detailed and valid reason why the TU in question should be removed.
Following the motion, standard voting procedure commences with a discussion
period of 7 days, a quorum of 75% of all TUs except for the TU being considered
for removal, and a voting period of 7 days.


----
SVP( general_removal_of_TU, 7, 0.75, 7);

The TU brought up for removal may defend themselves during the
discussion period, but may not vote on the proposal.


Special Removal of an Inactive TU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TU who has not done ANY of the following for a period of at least 2 months:

1. added, removed or updated a package in +[community]+ or the AUR

2. performed any action that required TU privileges on the AUR

3. posted a message to https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general]

OR who has not voted in a consecutive series of voting periods, the starting dates
of which span 2 months or more, shall be brought up for special removal due to
inactivity.

In this special case, the motion may be made by one TU instead of two, and SVP
is followed by a discussion period of 3 days, a quorum of 66%, and a voting
period of 5 days.

A TU must motion for an amendment by sending an announcement
to  https://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/aur-general[aur-general].
The message must either contain, or have attached, a patch against this
document which accomplishes the suggested change. SVP is commenced at the time
of the motion, with a discussion period of 5 days, a quorum of 75%, and a
voting period of 7 days.
